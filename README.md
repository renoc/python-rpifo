Random Playlist In Folder Order


##Purpose
Simple script to create a randomized playlist where certain sets of files are
played in order, but not immediately concurrent.

Subsets are controlled by folder structure, order is alphabetical by filename.
The LazyTv plugin for Kodi(XBMC) has a similar function, but RPIFO will work
in far less steps, without complicated internet searching logic, and available
in a format compatible with multiple media players and platforms.
